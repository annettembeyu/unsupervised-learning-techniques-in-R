## About the Project

You are a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). Your project has been divided into four parts where you'll explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on your insights.
This project is divided into four parts:

### Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction

This section of the project entails reducing your dataset to a low dimensional dataset using the t-SNE algorithm or PCA. You will be required to perform your analysis and provide insights gained from your analysis.

### Part 2: Feature Selection

This section requires you to perform feature selection through the use of the unsupervised learning methods learned earlier this week. You will be required to perform your analysis and provide insights on the features that contribute the most information to the dataset.

### Part 3: Association Rules

This section will require that you create association rules that will allow you to identify relationships between variables in the dataset. You are provided with a separate dataset that comprises groups of items that will be associated with others. Just like in the other sections, you will also be required to provide insights for your analysis.

### Part 4: Anomaly Detection

You have also been requested to check whether there are any anomalies in the given sales dataset. The objective of this task being fraud detection. 


## Practise Outcome
This project will help me gain more understanding and practise  on:
 * unsupervised learning algorithms to solving business problems.
 * the process of dimensionality reduction to a dataset.
 
 ## Technologies
 I analysed the data using Google Collab with runtype being R. 


## Scope
The Markdowns for each of the research question will comprise the following sections:

* Problem Definition
* Data Sourcing
* Check the Data
* Perform Data Cleaning
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis  (Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate)
* Implement the Solution
* Challenge the Solution
* Follow up Questions
