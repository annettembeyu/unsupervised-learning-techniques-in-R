## About the Project

You are a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). Your project has been divided into four parts where you'll explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on your insights.
This project is divided into four parts:

### Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction

This section of the project entails reducing your dataset to a low dimensional dataset using the t-SNE algorithm or PCA. You will be required to perform your analysis and provide insights gained from your analysis.

### Part 2: Feature Selection

This section involves performing feature selection through the use of the unsupervised learning methods. Then perform analysis and provide insights on the features that contribute the most information to the dataset.

### Part 3: Association Rules

In this section I will create association rules that will allow  identification of relationships between variables in the dataset. Using separate dataset that comprises groups of items that will be associated with others. Provide insights for to my analysis.

### Part 4: Anomaly Detection

The objective of this task is fraud detection by checking whether there are any anomalies in the given sales dataset.  


## Practise Outcome
This project will help me gain more understanding and practise  on:
 * unsupervised learning algorithms to solving business problems.
 * the process of dimensionality reduction to a dataset.
 
 ## Technologies
 I analysed the data using Google Collab with runtype being R. 


## Scope
The Markdowns for each of the research question will comprise the following sections:

* Problem Definition
* Data Sourcing
* Check the Data
* Perform Data Cleaning
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis  (Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate)
* Implement the Solution
* Challenge the Solution
* Follow up Questions
